<h2 class="projectTitles">What's all this about? 🧙🏻‍♀️🆚🐦‍⬛</h2>

<div><p><b>Wriggly Warty Witch</b> is a web game. The goal is to kill the witch controlling a bird able to shoot syringes. Although be careful, in the process you will encounter some obstacles: blowing clouds and warts thrown by the witch. Picturesque? You're right, the topics were chosen randomly. The target was to mix: warts, syringes and the sky, this is the result.</p></div>

<h2 class="projectTitles">Controls  🎮</h2>

<div><p>⦿The bird can move freely througout the whole screen using ←↑↓→ keys<br><br>⦿With the space key you can shoot the syringes. The shooting action has cooldown in order to make the playing experience more realistic (as realistic as it can be in a game that mixes warts, syringes, witches, birds and so on 😂) </p></div>
