<h2 class="projectTitles">What's all this about? üò∂</h2>

<div><p><b>FER 2013</b> (Face Emotion Recognition) is a dataset that offers the possibility to study a vast number of facial expressions and predict the emotion they are feeling. This project's goal is to analyze the influence of certain machine learning and computer vision techniques.</p><br><p>Starting by create a very simple <b>CNN</b> which classifies each picture and then apply little changes that almost doesn't mutate the model's structure, yet provide a considerable improvement in the classificator understanding of the problem.</p></div>

<h2 class="projectTitles">Techniques analyzed</h2>

<div id="list">
  <p id="list"> ‚¶ø Transfer learning</p>
  <p id="list"> ‚¶ø Fine tuning</p>
  <p id="list"> ‚¶ø Data augmentation</p>
  <p id="list"> ‚¶ø Label smoothing</p>
  <p id="list"> ‚¶ø Test time augmentation</p>
</div>

<h2 class="projectTitles">Dataset</h2>

<div>
  <p>All the images are 48x48, in grayscale, the faces are centered similarly and there are seven classes: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise and neutral. 28708 examples are to train and 7178 to test.</p>
  <p>As you can see in the sample emotions are ambiguous due to the fact that a face can be classified as more than one emotion and still be correct. Have we got better labels, the model would be much more accurate. To solve this problem I have used besides FER 2013 labels FER 2013+ ones, whom have been made by 10 persons each one voting a class.</p>
  <p>Moreover, some pictures aren't faces, so in FER 2013+ labels we have additional classes that help us clean the dataset. In conclusion, I have worked with two different labels to see how the model and the techniques adapt to these different situations.</p>
  <p>Furthermore it's an unbalanced problem:</p>

<h2 class="projectTitles">Choosing the base model</h2>

<div>
  <p>The perfect model must be fast to do as many experiments as possible and at the same time to have an acceptable precision in its classification. So I tried different configurations</p>

<div>
  <p>This models are made with <b>TensorFlow</b>. To see the code firsthand click on the demo at the top of the web.</p>
